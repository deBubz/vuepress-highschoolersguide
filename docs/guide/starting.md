## Programming Language

Programming Languages are the tools you will use to make software. It is not the actual language that your computer understands. Your code will need to be compiled by the language's compiler to be translated to lower level code to create an executable program.

*But what programming language should I start with??*

:::tip
Just pick one language to learn the fundamentals, see how everything works and as you figgured out what you want to learn. It'll be very easy picking up a new language.

Have a look at [r/learnprogramming wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_which_programming_language_should_i_start_with.3F), they have a very comprehensive guide on where to start out. Better yet, bookmark it, take your time to go through it. Its one of my main resources when starting out.

Heres a good [list of free cources](https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs) compiled by the youtuber [ForrestKnight](https://www.youtube.com/fknight) 

:::warning CAUTION
When starting out doing your research, you`ll be exposed to alot of advertisement for "quick online courses to learn programming". **Don't get them**, all of the content they say the course teach are free. Just do some digging.
