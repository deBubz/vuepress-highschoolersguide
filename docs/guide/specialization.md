# What is it

**Computer Science** is the science of Computers ofcourse <span class="smallertx">(heheheh)</span>.Studying Computer science does not nessecarity means you`ll only be a Programmer **OR** stick to one specialization path.
It depends on what you enjoy doing and what your job is, you could be doing one thing at work but you build all kind of different stuff in your freetime. Like mobile apps, websites(like tis), [arduino projects](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub), and much more.
Theres alot more to tech than most people understand.

::: tip
Whats **important** is the ability to sitdown and figgure out how to things work by yourself. **Uni** will not teach you everything.
