### Computer specs

*"Whats the required pc specs do I need?"* <br/>
*"Mac or Windows...<small>(or linux)</small>?"*<br/>
*"Do I need X or Y?"*<br/>

Are some of the general questions I see alot from people who are just starting out, and the best answer is:

::: tip
Use what ever you currently have, it does not matter what machine you are working on while starting out.
:::2Gb RAM

Take it from me, I leaned to program mostly on a tiny [Chromebook - $300](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DBGVB7K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which only had *2Gb RAM* and currently a [refurbished Thinkpad T420s - $500](https://shop.workventures.com.au/product-category/laptop-computer-packages/)
Having an expensive computer/laptop doesnt meant you're a better computer, it just means it cost more money.
